# Evenly - Prototype v1

A collaboration between Arthur V. and Haroun B. as Project no 3 of the Ironhack WebDev Bootcamp, Evently is an event organising platform where users can plan and join events in their area.

Features include: address lookup; geolocalisation; and geosearch.

## About Implementation

Build in a week thanks to the use of ReactJS and ExpressJS, which allowed for ease of collaboration and rapid prototyping. We also used:

- MUI for quick styling and structure.
- A document based database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
- JWT for authentication.
- adresse.data.gouv's API for address lookup.
- Hekoru for Backend deployment.
- Netlify for Frontend deployment.
